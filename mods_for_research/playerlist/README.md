# playerlist
Show a list of all online players (similar to minecrafts tab-list) when a player is pressing the playerlist key (by default: sneak).
Provides an API that can be used to hide or nick players, sort them and display them with different colors. (E.g. Display admins at the top of the list and make their name red). There is also a ping bar for every player (<= 20ms -> 4, <= 40ms -> 3, <= 60ms -> 2, > 60ms -> 1).

The playerlist key can be configured by changing the playerlist_key setting. Possible values are up, down, left, right, jump, aux1, sneak, dig, place or zoom.
